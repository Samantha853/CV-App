CV App for Sam


This is a web application developed through Python's Flask.

To run this app, activate a virtual environment for Python 3 by making use of the .env configuration file.

I have pip freezed (put) all the packages I made use of in developing this on the requirements.txt file which can be found in this directory.

Lastly, to run this app use the following command:

flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5001
